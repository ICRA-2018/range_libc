    "\n",
    "Bresenham's line algorithm [1] is one of the most widely used methods for two dimensional ray casting in occupancy grids. The algorithm incrementally determines the set of pixels that approximate the trajectory of a query ray starting from the query point (x,y)_{query} and progressing in the theta_{query} direction one pixel at a time. The algorithm terminates once the nearest occupied pixel is discovered, and the euclidean distance between that occupied pixel and (x,y)_{query} is reported. This algorithm is widely implemented in particle filters due to its simplicity and ability to operate on a dynamic map. The primary disadvantage is that it is slow, potentially requiring hundreds of memory accesses for a single ray cast. While average performance is highly environment dependent, Bresenham's Line algorithm is linear in map size in the worst case.\n",

    "Ray marching [2] is a well known algorithm, frequently used to accelerate fractal or volumetric graphical rendering applications. The basic idea can be understood very intuitively. Imagine that you are in an unknown environment, with a blindfold on. If an oracle tells you the distance to the nearest obstacle, you can surely move in any direction by at most that distance without colliding with any obstacle. By applying this concept recursively, one can step along a particular ray by the minimum distance to the nearest obstacle until colliding with some obstacle. The following figure demonstrates this idea graphically (from [3]).\n",
